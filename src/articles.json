        "title": "binary opposite states",
        "body": "state is defined as the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time. binary is defined as relating to, composed of, or involving two things. opposite is a person or thing that is totally different from or the reverse of someone or something else. when understanding a topic or solving a problem, i start by identifying its binary opposite states. this creates a range of subjectivity between two objective reference points. this framework gives me and others the ability to explore subjectivity within a commonly shared context. for example, let's say the task at hand is to classify shades of grey. if we cannot agree on the definition of white and  black, we will struggle when we differentiate between light grey and dark grey."
