        "title": "binary opposite states",
        "body": "state is defined as the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time. binary is defined as relating to, composed of, or involving two things. opposite is a person or thing that is totally different from or the reverse of someone or something else. when understanding a topic or solving a problem, i start by identifying its binary opposite states. this creates a range of subjectivity between two objective reference points. this framework gives me and others the ability to explore subjectivity within a commonly shared context. for example, let's say the task at hand is to classify shades of grey. if we cannot agree on the definition of white and  black, we will struggle when we differentiate between light grey and dark grey."

        "title": "collections and individuals",
        "body": "an individual may want or need to improve their ability to enter, improve or build social structures which involve more than one person---company, team, band, family, friends, etc. for this article, and this may change in the future, i am defining a social structure as a collection of individuals, their environment, and the (non-human) beings and (inanimate) things in their environment. the collection's structure (type of elements, rules, validations) creates a biased ecosystem within which individuals operate. imagine a social structure that does not track age of anything or anyone. this has many interesting implications. if they do not track age, they have not conceptualized age, or defined any language around it, and thus may have a completely different (than someone who tracks the age of beings and things) understanding of time. an individual outside of the collection may approach the group and proclaim that they are 25 years old! the collection would not understand, and would react with some mix of curiosity (hopefully), confusion, fear and anger. how would the 25 year old diffuse this confusion? years are a unit of time, and old describes age. in order to explain what 25 years old means, the individual would have to explain their conceptualization of age, and how they understand time. should the collection choose to update their understanding of time to include the concept of age, it would have to change its elements, rules and validations as well as the daily language and perception of all of its individuals (human and non-human beings). should the outside individual choose to update their understanding of time to include a lack of age, they would have to  change their daily language and perception. it may be easier and safer for the individual to continue their search of a better suited collection, one that tracks age, and it may be easier and safer for the collection to maintain order and sanity by not tracking age."

        "title": "emotion and feeling",
        "body": "emotion is defined as a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. feeling (noun) is defined as an emotional state or reaction. emotion causes a state of mind, feeling is a state of emotion. emotion is the input. state of mind is the output. feeling is the description of the input. emotion leads to a state that a mind takes on instinctively (i.e. reflexively, involuntarily, uncontrollably) as a response to chemical reactions in the body that are triggered by stimuli from internal and external (to the person) sources, physiological and psychological events or changes: event occurs > body reacts chemically > signals sent to the brain > mind takes on a certain state. the `signals sent to the brain` might be what we call emotion? we may not always be able to reason or justify why we feel what we feel, but it's likely that upon further reflection, we can correlate what we feel with events that happen. for example, watching horror movies make me feel frightened and stressed. when i'm not able to handle that state of mind (i.e. i'm tired or fatigued) i choose not to watch horror movies. after enough experiences, i've learned: that event has caused my body to react in a way that triggers signals to my brain which cause my mind to be in a certain state (fear, alertness) that is tiring and fatiguing. now a tangential but related idea: our mind tends to be efficient by using prediction (i.e. intuition, reflexes, etc) to close the gap between unknown > known and uncertain > certain. i am not saying that it does this accurately, but my mind tends to prefer the consequences of poor prediction over the uncomfortable experience of ambiguity. so in order to be efficient and responsive, we jump the gun on setting our state of mind before we actually receive stimuli. that's weird and probably not correct but this blog is a thought publication not a fact publication. maybe we see the precursors to the events which usually results in our body to react in a way which our mind achieves a particular state. so our mind says---hey i've seen this rodeo before, the event hasn't actually happened, but all signs indicate it to be approaching so let me just cut the chase and get to the state of mind before the event happens. if our mind has been over-trained or over-optimized for stress signals, especially if we experienced stress as a child, we might have over-sensitive prediction algorithms wired and trained in our brains for quick response and with the intention of keeping us safe. our mental state is also a form of stimuli that our body will react to. so if we get to a mental state of fear before anything fear-inducing actually happens our mind will still respond with whatever reinforces that state of mind. all the while, we could be factually incorrect about what is happening around us. if non-fear-inducing events set off our fear-sensors 'just in case', then we may lose an objective understanding of what is truly fear-inducing. everything becomes fear-inducing (or rather, events which may produce more nuanced emotional reactions are approximated as fear to save time) which means that true objectivity (categorizing events as harmful-to-my-well-being and not-harmful-to-my-well-being) is not present in how we react to events around us."

        "title": "intention and interpretation",
        "body": "intention (noun) is defined as an aim or a plan. interpretation (noun) is defined as the action of explaining the meaning of something. intention is the goal or expectation for a result. interpretation is the description of the actual result. imagine a 2d graph (like this: +). the x-axis represents the difference between intention and interpration (i.e. expectation vs. result). the y-axis represents the impact of that difference on the well-being of everyone affected by the result. let us explore points on this plane. the origin (0,0) would represent a situation where the intention and interpretation are fully aligned (0 difference) but there is no noticeable impact on everyone affected by the result. i don't think we can say anything about the validity or accuracy of the intentions (or morality of the intentions). a point in the first or second quadrants (top right and top left, respectively) represents a situation where there was a non-zero difference between the intention and interpretation of a result, and there was a positive impact on everyone affected by the result. lastly, a point in the  third or fourth quadrant (bottom left and bottom right, respectively) represents a situation where there was a non-zero difference between the intention and interpretation of a result, with a negative impact on everyone affected by the result. any point along the x-axis (not the origin) would represent a non-zero difference between intention and interpretation with 0 impact on everyone involved. any point along the y-axis (not the origin) would represent a non-zero impact with a zero-difference between intention and interpretation. the process of creating this graph before making a decision may inspire insightful questions: how are we measuring impact? how are we measuring intention? how are we measuring interpretaion? the process of viewing this graph after making a decision may inspire retrospective questions: are our intentions resulting in non-zero impact? what does it mean when a non-zero difference between intention and interpretation results in non-zero impact? what does it mean when a close-to-zero or zero-difference between intention and interpretation resulted in non-zero impacts on everyone involved? do these results match our intuition? if not, what needs to change---our intuition, how we defined and collected the parameters on this graph, how we are representing them, or nothing at all?"
