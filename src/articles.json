        "body": "state is defined as the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time. binary is defined as relating to, composed of, or involving two things. opposite is a person or thing that is totally different from or the reverse of someone or something else. when understanding a topic or solving a problem, i start by identifying its binary opposite states. this creates a range of subjectivity between two objective reference points. this framework gives me and others the ability to explore subjectivity within a commonly shared context. for example, let's say the task at hand is to classify shades of grey. if we cannot agree on the definition of white and  black, we will struggle when we differentiate between light grey and dark grey."

        "body": "an individual may want or need to improve their ability to enter, improve or build social structures which involve more than one person---company, team, band, family, friends, etc. for this article, and this may change in the future, i am defining a social structure as a collection of individuals, their environment, and the (non-human) beings and (inanimate) things in their environment. the collection's structure (type of elements, rules, validations) creates a biased ecosystem within which individuals operate. imagine a social structure that does not track age of anything or anyone. this has many interesting implications. if they do not track age, they have not conceptualized age, or defined any language around it, and thus may have a completely different (than someone who tracks the age of beings and things) understanding of time. an individual outside of the collection may approach the group and proclaim that they are 25 years old! the collection would not understand, and would react with some mix of curiosity (hopefully), confusion, fear and anger. how would the 25 year old diffuse this confusion? years are a unit of time, and old describes age. in order to explain what 25 years old means, the individual would have to explain their conceptualization of age, and how they understand time. should the collection choose to update their understanding of time to include the concept of age, it would have to change its elements, rules and validations as well as the daily language and perception of all of its individuals (human and non-human beings). should the outside individual choose to update their understanding of time to include a lack of age, they would have to  change their daily language and perception. it may be easier and safer for the individual to continue their search of a better suited collection, one that tracks age, and it may be easier and safer for the collection to maintain order and sanity by not tracking age."

        "title": "emotion and feeling",
        "body": "emotion is defined as a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. feeling (noun) is defined as an emotional state or reaction. emotion causes a state of mind, feeling is a state of emotion. emotion is the input. state of mind is the output. feeling is the description of the input. emotion is the state that a mind takes on instinctively (i.e. reflexively, involuntarily, uncontrollably) as a response to stimuli (caused by chemical reactions in your body) to internal and external, physiological and psychological events or changes: event occurs > body reacts chemically > they trigger signals sent to the brain > mind takes on a certain state. we may not always be able to reason or justify why we feel what we feel, but it's likely that upon further reflection, we can correlate what we feel with events that happen. for example, watching horror movies make me feel frightened and stressed. when i'm not able to handle that state of mind (i.e. i'm tired or fatigued) i choose not to watch horror movies. after enough experiences, i've learned that event has caused my body to react in a way that triggers signals to my brain which cause my mind to be in a certain state (fear, alertness) that is tiring and fatiguing."
